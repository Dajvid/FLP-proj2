# Rubik's cube solver (flp20-log)
This program is supposed to solve instances of rubik's cube puzzle.
This is school project for [FLP](https://www.fit.vut.cz/study/course/13926/.en)
course at [BUT FIT](https://www.fit.vut.cz/.en) in academic year 2020/2021.

## Compilation
Project can be compiled by `make` command in a project root directory. Dependencies for compilation are `make` and `swipl` utilities.

## Execution
After compilation solver can be run as:

    ./flp20-log
Afterwards input is expected on standard input in form of 2D cube net. Example input:

    uuu
    uuu
    uuu
    fff rrr bbb lll
    fff rrr bbb lll
    fff rrr bbb lll
    ddd
    ddd
    ddd
Where:
-   `u` represents upper side,
-   `f` represents front side,
-   `r` represents right side,
-   `b` represents back side,
-   `l` represents left side,
-   `d` represents bottom side.

Input is not validated, so be sure to provide only valid rubik's cube instances.

## Implementation
I implemented two approaches using blind space state search methods, Iterative Deepening Search (IDS) and Bredth First Search (BFS).

### Modules
Implementation consis of following modules:
-   RubikMain with main rule, which is entry point for the whole program,
-   RubikIO for reading and printing of rubik's cube instances,
-   RubikRotations holds predicates that represent possible moves.
-   RubikIDS with implementation of IDS state space search algorithm,
-   RubikBFS with implementation of BFS state space search algorithm.

## Test suite
Test inputs are located in cubes folder inside project root. Test suite consis of multiple cube instances each solvable in different minimal number of moves. Minimal number of moves is also mentioned in input's filename.

Each input was generated by N random moves from solved cube (consecutive opossite moves are no allowed). Program used to generate input is located in `cubes/RubikScramble.pl`. Afterwards I also verified if minimum number of moves needed to solve the cube corresponds to N (number of moves used to generate the cube instance).
